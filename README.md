# Pneumonia-Detection-in-Chest-X-Rays-with-Ensemble-Model-Pretrained-CNNs-
- The Chest X-ray Pneumonia dataset is a publicly available collection of pediatric chest radiograph images used to train and evaluate deep learning models for the detection of pneumonia. Sourced from the Guangzhou Women and Children’s Medical Center, this dataset consists of 5,863 X-ray images, each labeled as either 'NORMAL' or 'PNEUMONIA'. It is organized into three main folders: train, val, and test, which represent the training, validation, and testing sets respectively. Each of these folders contains two subdirectories corresponding to the two classes. The training set is the largest and is used to teach the model, while the validation set helps fine-tune the model during training, and the test set evaluates its final performance. This structured dataset supports supervised learning and plays a crucial role in building AI-based diagnostic tools that can assist radiologists in identifying pneumonia accurately and efficiently, particularly in low-resource or high-demand healthcare environments.
- In this project, developed a deep learning-based image classification system to detect pneumonia from chest X-ray images using an ensemble of pretrained models. Leveraging the publicly available Chest X-Ray Pneumonia dataset from Kaggle, and then applied data preprocessing techniques including image resizing, normalization, and augmentation to prepare the data for training. Initially, built a custom CNN to establish a baseline, and then enhanced performance by integrating three powerful pretrained models—VGG16, ResNet50, and MobileNetV2—into an ensemble architecture. By combining the feature representations from each model and using a dense classification head, and achieved high accuracy and improved generalization on unseen test data. The ensemble model proved effective in correctly classifying new chest X-ray images as either ‘Pneumonia’ or ‘Normal’, demonstrating its potential as a reliable diagnostic support tool in clinical settings.
